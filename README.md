# libmarugarou (lib丸刈ろう) — a reader for CLIP STUDIO PAINT files

**Note: This library is still very unstable!**

## Capabilities

Right now this library can only extract the canvas previews from a Clip Studio Paint file.

Hopefully we can expand its capabilities.

## Maru what?

The name of this project comes from the Japanese word 丸刈り (Hepburn: marugari), which can also appear as a verb: 丸刈る (marugaru).

The volitional tense is used, yielding 丸刈ろう (marugarō)!
